Citadel under DOJ Investigation 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/17654wk/citadel_under_investigation_by_doj_that_was_mar/

"
The DoJ is not looking to "carry out justice" because justice in this case is a catch-22:

    Prosecute short sellers and you signal that every person with access to a broker that buying GME is a ticket to fortune = Exteme FOMO, bad idea.

    Prosecute and freeze GME from trading to resolve it through unprecedented legal means = US markets take a huge blow to their credibility for having to abandon market dynamics

    Don't prosecute and help them kick the can while keeping them on a tight leash = Best option
"
