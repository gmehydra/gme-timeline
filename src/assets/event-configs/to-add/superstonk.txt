mod comment:
We are seeing a ton of reposts of this particular AMA. The company behind this AMA is paying Reddit to promote this AMA to Superstonk in the form of ads. The mod team has sincere and well-founded concerns that discussion/coordination about participating in this AMA (which will not be hosted on Superstonk in any way, shape or form) could be considered brigading by Reddit Admins. As a result, we are having to remove all reposted posts referencing this AMA. We are also removing any comment indicating that people are going to participate or ask a specific question.
These removals come with a strong warning that discussions about other subs, coordination about participating in discussions on other subs, or harassing Reddit users in their AMA will be met with zero tolerance. We have to adopt this position to keep our sub safe and in compliance with Reddit rules.
Please, please, just don't bring this AMA content to Superstonk. We don't need it here.
I'm locking comments on this post because we're seeing an uptick in "I'm going to ask him... " and that's *exactly* what could get this sub in trouble. Please, don't engage with this content, and just focus on GME.
