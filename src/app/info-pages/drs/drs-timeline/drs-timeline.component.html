        Discovery and journey of DRS by GME shareholders
    </div>
    <p>
        In the aftermath of the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">GME sneeze of January 2021</a>, GME shareholders
        began to search for information to help make sense of what really happened and how the market actually
        works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through a series of discoveries and conversations, GME shareholders eventually learned
        that DRS was the only way that shareholders could take ownership of their shares away from the DTC and
        give it to themselves.
