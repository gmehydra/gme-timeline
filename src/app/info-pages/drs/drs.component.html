                        target="_blank">DTC</a>, legally owns the large majority of all issued stocks in the United
                    States

                        <li>
                            As of 1998, Cede & Co. owned 83% of all issued stocks in the United States. Since 1998, this
                            ownership percentage has not been publicly released again
                        </li>
                        <li>Any time shares of a company are purchased at a stock broker, the legal owner of those
                            shares is
                            Cede & Co.</li>
                        <li>Due to lack of transparency by Cede & Co. and the DTC, the number of share entitlements that
                            exist
                            among stock brokers and other market participants cannot be verified</li>

                <li>DRS is an acronym for Direct Registration System

                    <ul>

                        <li>DRS is a mechanism that enables investors to remove shares from the DTC's ownership and
                            registers them with the issuing company's transfer agent in the name of the investor, making
                            them them the legal owner of the shares</li>
                        <li>Holding shares in DRS form is the only way to have genuine legal ownership of your shares
                        </li>

                <li>GameStop's transfer agent is Computershare</li>

                <li>GME shareholders are challenging the status quo by directly registering billions of dollars worth of
                    shares, owning approximately 14% of GameStop in DRS holdings. No other company in history has had a large portion of
                    their shares owned by directly registered shareholders</li>

            <div class="section-heading">Held by registered holders at Computershare: DRS versus DSPP</div>
            <P>All shares held with GameStop's transfer agent Computershare are considered "registered",
                which means that the individual investor is listed by name on the issuer's (GameStop's) stock ledger (also referred to as
                the "register") and is thus known to the company.
                <br>
                However, of registered shares, there is a significant distinction between shares held in DRS form versus shares held in DSPP
                form.
