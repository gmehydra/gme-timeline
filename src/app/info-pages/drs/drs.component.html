                        <li>Due to lack of transparency by Cede & Co. and the DTC, the number of share entitlements that

                        <li>DRS is a mechanism that enables shareholders to remove shares from the DTC's ownership and
                            registering them in the books of the issuing

            <p>
                In the aftermath of the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">GME sneeze of January 2021</a>, GME shareholders
                began to search for information to help make sense of what really happened and how the market actually
                works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through a series of discoveries and conversations, GME shareholders eventually learned
                that DRS was the only way that shareholders could take ownership of their shares away from the DTC and give it to themselves.
