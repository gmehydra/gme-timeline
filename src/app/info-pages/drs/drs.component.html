            <ul>
                <li>DRS is an acronym for Direct Registration System</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company" target="_blank">Cede & Co.</a>, a private
                    company and parter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_Company"
                        target="_blank">DTC</a>, owns the large majority of all issued stocks in the United States</li>
                <li>As of 1998, Cede & Co. owned 83% of all issued stocks in the United States. Since 1998, this
                    ownership percentage has not been publicly released again</li>
                <li>Any time shares of a company are purchased at a stock broker, the legal owner of those shares is
                    Cede & Co.</li>
                <li>DRS is a mechanism that enables shareholders to have sole legal title ownership of the shares that
                    they paid for by removing them from the DTC's books and registering them in the books of the issuing
                    company's transfer agent</li>
                <li>GameStop's transfer agent is Computershare</li>
                <li>Due to lack of transparency by Cede & Co. and the DTC, the number of share entitlements that exist
                    among stock brokers and other market participants cannot be verified</li>
                <li>GME shareholders are challenging the status quo by directly registering billions of dollars worth of
                    shares, owning approximately 25% of GameStop</li>
