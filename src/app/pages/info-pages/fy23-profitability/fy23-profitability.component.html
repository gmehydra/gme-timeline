                    financial results</a> for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended
                    February 3, 2024, demonstrating small but not insignificant full-year profits for the first time in
                    6 years, despite reduced revenues.

                    "Net income was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to a net loss of $313.1 million for

                    Sentiment of GameStop found in financial media continues to be negative and cynical, despite the

                    management team.

            </div>
            <p>
                From a historical point of view, GameStop was consistently profitable
                every fiscal year from 2005 through 2016, with the exception of 2012.  
                Starting in fiscal year 2017, GameStop began showing reduced profitability, and from FY 2018 through FY
                2022, was unprofitable.</p>

            <p>
                Looking exclusively at revenue, it is clear that there has been a significant reduction starting approximately with fiscal year 2019. 
                Much of this can be attributed to the fact that gamers are increasingly buying games digitally
                rather than in the form of physical discs such as can be purchased at a brick-and-mortar retail store
                like GameStop.
            </p>
            <p>Yet, even in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, it is clear that despite high revenues the company was not
                performing well.  </p>
            <p>
                Heading through 2020, GameStop was undeniably a struggling company facing significant headwinds, and according to many, was destined for bankruptcy.  The trading price of GME reflected this prevailing sentiment, and the financial media was dutifully critical.

                In 2020, activist investor Ryan Cohen began purchasing shares of GME, ultimately becoming approximately 12% owner of the company.  
                By June 2021, the entire board of directors of the company was replaced by Ryan Cohen and his associates, with Ryan Cohen becoming chairman of the board.
                From this time onward, the company was completely in the hands of this new leadership team.
            </p>
            <p>By end of fiscal year 2023, the new leadership has taken the company from a situation where it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year to net profitability.</p>
